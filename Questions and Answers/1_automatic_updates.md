### Q. How is this different from what it was before?
A. This feature follows plugins and themes auto-updates user interface which was shipped in WordPress 5.5.

Currently, by default, WordPress auto-updates itself, but only for minor releases. With this option enabled WordPress will be automatically updated for major versions as well.  

The feature of auto-updating core to major versions has been in WordPress for years. 
But now it will be accessible not only for developers but also via user interface located on the Updates screen. Therefore, site admin can opt-in to automatic updates for major versions easily and have their website automatically kept up to date with each new version of WordPress.

### Q. Are auto-updates enabled by default?
A. For new WordPress installations: yes, itâ€™s enabled by default.
For existing WordPress installations (if you are updating your existing site to 5.6): no, you must opt-in to enable Automatic updates for major WordPress Core releases. 

Note: automatic updates for minor releases are enabled by default since WordPress 3.7.
