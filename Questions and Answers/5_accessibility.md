# Accessibility

These questions are from the accessibility teamâ€™s suggestions and based on search research of what end users are asking about. On this page, you will find answers for questions and answers for two audience segments: non technical user and developer. They will be published on HelpHub and Developer Hub accordingly. Please keep answers clear for a non technical user in that section.

The answer drafts are from accessibility documents. They still need to be made clearer to understand to help these audiences engage with the improvements.
