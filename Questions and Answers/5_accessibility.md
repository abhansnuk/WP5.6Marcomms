## Questions and Answers - aimed at supporting Developers 

### Q1: How does the default theme, Twenty Twenty One support accessibility? 
A: The default Twenty Twenty One theme puts accessibility at the center of your website. It conforms to the [WordPress accessibility-ready guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/) and addresses several more specialized standards from the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance). It will help you meet the highest level of international accessibility standards when you create accessible content and choose plugins that are accessible too!

### Q2: What does it mean to be WCAG 2.1 AAA ready?
A: WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, a set of recommendations for ensuring Web content is more accessible to a wide range of people with disabilities. The current standard is 2.1. 
AAA refers to a level of conformance: in order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). 
If you follow the WCAG guidelines as you create content for your site, you can help make your website more accessible.

A: Twenty Twenty One is the bundled theme in WordPress 5.6. 
This default Twenty Twenty One theme puts accessibility at the heart of your website. It conforms to the WordPress accessibility-ready guidelines and addresses several more specialized standards from the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance). It will help you meet the highest level of international accessibility standards when you create accessible content and choose plugins which are accessible too!

### Q3: I am using the Twenty Twenty-One theme. Does this mean that the plugins I am using are ready for WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance?
A. While the Twenty Twenty-One theme will help you meet the highest level of international accessibility standards, content and plugins may not always conform to these standards. We recommend [writing accessible content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/) and choosing plugins that claim to be accessible as a first step. 

Choose plugins carefully. [The WordPress Accessibility Team](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/) suggests users check each plugin and not rely on the plugins’ own description. You should be extra cautious of plugins that create interactive elements (such as carousels, sliders, dropdowns, menus, pop-ups, accordions, and tabs) as they are not often coded with accessibility in mind.  

As you add to your site, continue to [test and evaluate your site’s web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/) to ensure it continues to conform to the standard level your site aims to meet. 

### Q: What tools are available to help me make my current website more accessible?
A: You can start checking for web accessibility by using the [Accessibility Team’s Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/test-for-web-accessibility/) to evaluate your site and make sure you are following [their guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/best-practices/).  

### Q: Where can I find themes that have an accessibility focus?
A: A list of accessible themes can be found in the WordPress Themes Repository that include the [accessibility-ready](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/) tag. 

### Q: What is an ‘Accessibility Statement’, and why do I need one on my website?
A: An accessibility statement is a page on your website that explains the level of web accessibility that your site aims to achieve and includes an overview of its current accessibility features. 

An accessibility statement is an asset to your site because not only do you show that you care about accessibility and your site visitors, you provide helpful information about the accessibility of your content. In other cases, you may be required to provide an accessibility statement. This W3C list of [Web Accessibility Laws and Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) can help you figure out if those instances apply to your site. 
More information on [Accessibility Statements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/).

### Q: What is the ‘Accessibility Statement Feature’ plugin, and how do I use it? 
A: The Accessibility Statement Feature Plugin helps you show visitors you care about making your site accessible and explains functionality and known limitations in common terms. The plugin generates the content structure of an [accessibility statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/) for your WordPress website. 
Customize the generated statement  to provide your contact information for feedback and describe your website’s current accessibility features. Note that in some situations you may be required to provide particular content in your accessibility statements. For example, there are [specific requirements for accessibility statements in relation to the EU Web Accessibility Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2018/1523/oj).
The Accessibility Statement Feature plugin works in a similar way as the [WordPress Privacy Policy Tool](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-privacy/#privacy-policy-editing-helper). Select an existing page to use with the generated content, or create a new page as needed.  
 


### Q: How do I move meta boxes with my keyboard?
