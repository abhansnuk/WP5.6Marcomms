## Questions and Answers - aimed at supporting non-developers 

### Q1. What is the difference between WordPress theme Twenty Twenty and Twenty Twenty-One?
A. Both themes have high levels of accessibility and performance and follow good practice. Just like other WordPress default themes, they receive the necessary updates to be fully compatible with the latest WordPress version.

The main reason to choose the new Twenty Twenty-One theme is its modern design, freshness and flexibility. Twenty Twenty-One adds beautifully styled block patterns, block styles, and a custom color palette to make adding content to your site easy. This theme has a new color palette with pastel colors ideal for different purposes from a photographer’s personal portfolio to a cosmetic store, or beauty blog. It is also the first time where the default WordPress theme has a Dark mode feature.  


### Q2. What are the benefits of using a WordPress default theme Twenty Twenty-One? 

This new theme has:

#### 1. A unique design pattern in line with modern trends.

#### 4. Highest level of Accessibility from WordPress default themes

While the Twenty Twenty-One theme is of this highest accessibility level, accessibility of your site will also depend on which plugins you install. The WordPress Accessibility team recommends that you review all plugins for accessibility before installing them on your site. [These scores](https://web.dev/accessibility-scoring/) are also dependent on which plugins you have on your site as well, so be careful and do your research before choosing to install a plugin on your site.

The WordPress community has a whole team devoted to accessibility which will be celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2021. If you want to find more about their work or to and get involved, [visit](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/)

Try the Twenty Twenty-One theme for yourself and discover its many benefits. The Release Squad working with many other contributors across the WordPress open source project have done a lot of work on this theme and it’s an exciting step forward

### Q3. What is the Dark Mode in Twenty Twenty-One Theme?

Twenty Twenty-One will include support for Dark Mode. This feature can be enabled within the Customizer.

![Dark Mode in 2021 theme](https://github.com/wpmarketingteam/WP5.6Marcomms/blob/master/Questions%20and%20Answers/images/Dark-Mode1.png "Dark Mode in 2021 theme")

Dark Mode allows the site to honor a visitor’s dark mode preferences on the device they are using to view your site.

Once enabled, the front-end of the site will show a floating button to enable or disable dark mode.

![Dark Mode in 2021 theme](https://github.com/wpmarketingteam/WP5.6Marcomms/blob/master/Questions%20and%20Answers/images/dark-mode-buttons-in-front-end.png "Dark Mode in 2021 theme")

If a visitor to your site has dark mode enabled in their system preferences, the site will default to their chosen preference (dark mode on/off).  The Dark Mode: On/Off button will float in front of your content, in the bottom right corner of your site.

If you do enable dark mode, pay attention to any logos and graphics used on your site.

Be sure to test your site for good contrast between the text, any graphics and chosen background color on your site. One of the many resources for testing accessibility is [https://wave.webaim.org/](https://wave.webaim.org/)

### Q2. What is the best way to make a customized version of the Twenty Twenty-One theme?
A. To further customize the Twenty Twenty--One theme you can follow these steps:

1. Create a “twentytwentyone-child” folder.
2. Create “style.css” file inside with minimum required information:

```
/*
 Theme Name:   Twenty Twenty-One Child
 Theme URI:	http://example.com/twenty-twenty-one-child/
 Description:  Twenty Twenty-One Child Theme
 Author:   	YOUR NAME CHANGE THIS
 Author URI:   http://example.com
 Template: 	twentytwentyone
 Version:  	1.0.0
 License:  	GNU General Public License v2 or later
 License URI:  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 Tags:     	light, dark, two-columns, right-sidebar, responsive-layout
 Text Domain:  twentytwentyone child
*/

```

You can create new styles or add your custom functions in “functions.php”. Then, activate your theme by going to Dashboard > Appearance > Themes. Select  your new child theme and click “Activate” to enjoy your Twenty Twenty-One Child theme.

Keep in mind that not all themes include parents’ styles automatically. The Twenty Twenty-One theme will do this for you.

More information about how to create a Child theme you can view the process at:  [https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/)
