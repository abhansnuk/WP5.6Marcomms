### Q1. I still use the Classic Editor, will this new update affect it?
A. No, the classic editor plugin will continue to be maintained until 2022. In the Writing Settings of your site, you can decide which editor to use for each page or post. Alternatively, you can use the classic block available in the Block Editor:: https://wordpress.org/support/article/classic-block/ 


### Q2. Can I still use a  third-party page builder?
A. The hope is that the core editor has what you need! If it doesnâ€™t, feature requests are always welcome. However, whether you choose to use a page builder or not is entirely up to you as the end-user. The potential compatibility of the page builder with these new Gutenberg updates is entirely dependent on the third party that develops your page builder. If you do run into issues we recommend you reach out directly to them so they can help advise you.


### Q3. What are Block Patterns?
A. The block patterns are pre-configured  blocks, added via core, themes, and plugins, that you can add to your content similar to single blocks. Block patterns  can be registered to use any core block or 3rd party block present on a site.

### Q4. Is the Gutenberg plugin required to use the Block Editor?
A. Since WordPress 5.0, the Block Editor is present in the WordPress core and the Gutenberg plugin is no longer required. However, if you would like to see what is being developed with the WordPress editor, the Gutenberg plugin will provide  access to newer features that are under development, and not yet included in the WordPress core. This currently includes Full Site Editing!
